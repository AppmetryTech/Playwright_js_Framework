## Overview
This project uses Playwright and the Page Object Model (POM) framework to perform end-to-end testing on web applications. It includes web testing, API testing and visual testing.

## Page Object Model (POM) Framework
The POM framework is used to organize test code and make it more maintainable. It involves creating a separate class for each page in the application being tested, with methods representing the actions that can be performed on that page.
